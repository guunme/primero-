    <p>My name is Gunin Agarwal, I am a rising junior studying Mathematics, 
      Communication and Philosophy. I love living life to the fullest. I love food, music, 
      and fashion. I find myself to be very eclectic in all of those fields, specially music. 
      My favorite designers are Demna Gvasalia and Kris Van Assche. My favorite artists are 
      JCole, Asvp Rocky, Beatles, Pink Floyd, Ludovico Einaudi, and Arvo Part. I was born in 
      India, raised in both India and Thailand, and then came to Queens when I was 7 years old. I
      love travelling and exploring this world. My favorite place so far is Samana, Dominican Republic. 
      I am a firm believer in working for myself and not having a job. I have an app startup targeted for 
      street parking in New York City, Spotz. Spotz is my baby and project to get me where I want to be. "Remain 
      in a constant state of departure, while always arriving.".
